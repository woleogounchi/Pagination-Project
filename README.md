# techdegree-project2

In this project, we'll be using a common web development technique known as **"pagination"**to enhance the usability of a web page.

The project starts with a page that contains a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses. *JavaScript* code will be written in order to display 10 names at a time, and add a navigation system -- a series of links at the bottom of the page -- to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time.

While making these improvements, you'll use the principle of **"progressive enhancement"**. The page should still display the students' names without *JavaScript* turned on, but will be much improved (enhanced) with the *JavaScript* programming we add. In other words, *JavaScript* will added to paginate and improve the project, without altering the project in such a way that *JavaScript* will be required to use the web page.
